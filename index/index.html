                <p>The majority of my adult life has been focused around customer service, office work, sales, order processing, and information management. I enjoy working directly with customers and co-workers even though my strengths are in information management and behind the scenes tasks.</p>

                <p>After serving in the U.S. Active Army from 2008 to 2013 I graduated from the University of Wisconsin Stout in 2015 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Golf Enterprise Management and a Minor in Business Administration.
